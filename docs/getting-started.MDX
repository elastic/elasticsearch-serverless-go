This page guides you through the installation process of the Serverless Go 
client, shows you how to instantiate the client, and how to perform basic 
Elasticsearch operations with it.


## Requirements

* Go 1.13 or higher installed on your system.


## Installation


### Using the command line

You can install the Elasticsearch Serverless Go client with the following 
commands:

```bash
go get -u github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-serverless-go@latest
```


## Instantiate a client

You can instantiate a client by running the following command:

```go
client, err := elasticsearch.NewClient(elasticsearch.Config{
	APIKey: "you_api_key",
	Address: "https://my-project-url",
})
```

You can find the Elasticsearch endpoint on the Cloud deployment management page.

You can create a new API Key under **Stack Management** > **Security**:

## Using the API

After you instantiated a client with your API key and Elasticsearch endpoint, 
you can start ingesting documents into the Elasticsearch Service. You can use 
the Bulk API for this. This API enables you to index, update, and delete several 
documents in one request.


### Creating an index and ingesting documents

You can call the `bulk` API with a body parameter, an array of hashes that 
define the action, and a document. 

The following is an example of indexing some classic books into the `books` 
index:

```go
books := []Book{
    {Name: "Snow Crash", Author: "Neal Stephenson", ReleaseDate: "1992-06-01", PageCount: 470},
    {Name: "Revelation Space", Author: "Alastair Reynolds", ReleaseDate: "2000-03-15", PageCount: 585},
    {Name: "1984", Author: "George Orwell", ReleaseDate: "1949-06-08", PageCount: 328},
    {Name: "Fahrenheit 451", Author: "Ray Bradbury", ReleaseDate: "1953-10-15", PageCount: 227},
    {Name: "Brave New World", Author: "Aldous Huxley", ReleaseDate: "1932-06-01", PageCount: 268},
    {Name: "The Handmaid's Tale", Author: "Margaret Atwood", ReleaseDate: "1985-06-01", PageCount: 311},
}
indexName := "books"

bulk := client.Bulk()
for _, book := range books {
    bulk.CreateOp(types.CreateOperation{Index_: &indexName}, book)
}
response, err := bulk.Do(context.TODO())

fmt.Printf("%#v", response.Items)
```

When you use the client to make a request to Elasticsearch, it returns an API 
response object. You can access the body values directly as seen on
the previous example with `res`.


### Getting documents

You can get documents by using the following code:

```go
client.Get("my_index", id).Do(context.TODO())
```


### Searching

Now that some data is available, you can search your documents using the 
**Search API**:

```go
client.Search().
	Index("books").
	Q("snow").
	Do(context.TODO())
```

### Updating a document

You can call the `update` API to update a document:

```go
client.Update("books", "document_id").
		Doc(
			struct {
				PageCount int `json:"page_count"`
			}{PageCount: 312},
		).
		Do(context.TODO())
```

### Deleting a document

You can call the `delete` API to delete a document:

```go
client.Delete("books", "document_id").Do(context.TODO())
```


### Deleting an index


```go
client.Indices.Delete("books").Do(context.TODO())
```
